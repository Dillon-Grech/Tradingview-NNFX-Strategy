# Tradingview-NNFX-Strategy
This repository will guide you on how to start coding in TradingView using the Pinescript native language. Users should go through this repository in conjunction with the supplied YouTube tutorials provided on my YouTube channel @Dillon Grech. We will be coding the NNFX strategy as a demonstration which utilises multiple indicators and money management techniques; perfect for beginners. 
This repository is tailored for beginners to intermediates coming into coding. Some trading experience or financial literacy is recommended but not necessarily required.
